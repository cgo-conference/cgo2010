<p>The International Symposium on Code Generation and Optimization
(CGO) provides a premier venue to bring together researchers and
practitioners working on feedback-directed optimization and back-end
compilation techniques. The conference covers optimization for
parallelism, performance, power, and security, where that optimization
occurs in the mapping from an input (including APIs, high-level
languages, byte codes such as .NET or Java, or ISAs) to a similar or
lower-level target machine representation. </p>

<p>

Undergraduate and graduate students are encouraged to submit posters
to CGO 2010 pertaining to research topics relevant to CGO (see the
Call for Papers for a list of relevant topics). Posters provide an
excellent opportunity for short presentations and informal discussions
with CGO attendees. Posters will be displayed during a poster session,
giving presenters a chance to showcase their latest results and
innovations.
</p>
<p>
A submission must include an abstract of up to 400 words. Including a
rough sketch of the poster is recommended. Also include a URL of a web
site related to the poster, if applicable. Poster submissions are now
being accepted. <!-- Further details on submission information can be found
at:

<p>
<b>Submissions can be emailed to the Student Poster Chair,
Tipp Moseley (<a href="mailto:tipp@google.com">tipp@google.com</a>)</b>
</p>

<p>
Students are encouraged to create 36"x48" laminated posters (e.g.,
<a href="http://fedex.com/us/office/marketing/signsbanners/posters/packages.html?lid=Learnmore_posters_packages">FedEx/Kinkos</a>
).  Alternately, for students wishing to construct posters from
standard sheets of paper, we will provide a blank 36"x48" poster board
and glue (upon request) before the presentation session.
