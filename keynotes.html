<h2>Performance is Dead, Long Live Performance!</h2>

<p>In a world of social networking, security attacks, and hot mobile phones,
the importance of application performance appears to have diminished. My own
research agenda has shifted from looking at the performance of memory
allocation to building runtime systems that are more resilient to data
corruption and security attacks. In my talk, I will outline a number of areas
where code-generation and runtime techniques can be successfully applied to
areas for purposes other than performance, such as fault tolerance,
reliability, and security. Along the way, I will consider such questions as
"Does it really matter if this corruption was caused by a software or hardware
error?" and "Is it okay to let a malicious person allocate arbitrary data on my
heap?".</p>

<p>Despite these other opportunities, the importance of performance in modern
applications remains undiminished, and current hardware trends place an
increasing burden on software to provide needed performance boosts. In
concluding, I will suggest several important trends that I believe will help
define the next 10 years of code generation and optimization research.  </p>

<p><b>Ben Zorn</b> is a Principal Researcher at Microsoft Research. After
receiving a PhD in Computer Science from UC Berkeley in 1989, he served eight
years on the Computer Science faculty at the University of Colorado in Boulder,
receiving tenure and being promoted to Associate Professor in 1996. He left the
University of Colorado in 1998 to join Microsoft Research, where he currently
works. Ben's research interests include programming language design and
implementation and performance measurement and analysis. He has served as an
Associate Editor of the ACM journals Transactions on Programming Languages and
Systems and Transactions on Architecture and Code Optimization and he currently
serves as a Member-at-Large of the SIGPLAN Executive Committee. For more

<h2>There Are At Least Two Sides to Every Heterogeneous System</h2>

<p>Since there are at least two sides to every heterogeneous system, optimizing
for heterogeneous systems is inherently an exercise in managing complexity,
balanced trade-offs and layering.  Efforts to make the hardware simple may
result in software complexity, unless there's an abstracting software layer
involved.  Different customer-driven usage models make it challenging to
offer a layered but consistent programming model, a cost-effective set of
performance features and a flexibly-capable systems software stack.  And
often, the very reasons why heterogeneous systems exist drives them to
change over time, making them difficult to target from a code generation 
perspective.</p>

<p>As a company that provides hardware systems, compilers, systems software
infrastructure and services, one of Intel's research and development focuses is
on optimizing for heterogeneous systems, such as a mix of IA multicores and
Larrabee processors that are used for both graphics and compute co-processing.
This talk addresses some of the challenges we've encountered in that space, and
offers some potential directions.</p> 

<p>Primary among the case studies used in this talk is a dynamic compiler that
uses Intel's Ct technology, which strives to make it easier for programmers to
specify what data-parallel work needs to be accomplished, and manages
extracting parallelism from the application and making use of it on multicore,
manycore and compute co-processor architectures.  The set of issues that will
be addressed include how to specify parallelism, safety and debugging, software
infrastructure and compiler architecture, and achieving performance on
heterogeneous systems.</p>

<p><b>Chris (CJ) Newburn</b> serves as a feature architect for Intel's Intel64
platforms, and has contributed to a combination of hardware and software
technologies that span heterogeneous compiler optimizations, middleware,
JVM/JIT/GC optimization, acceleration hardware, ISA changes, microcode and
microarchitecture over the last twelve years.  Performance analysis and tuning
have figured prominently in the development and production readiness work that
he's done.  He likes to work on projects that span the hardware-software
boundary, that span organizations, and that foster collaboration across
organizations.  He has submitted nearly twenty patents and has numerous journal
and conference publications.  He helped start CGO, has served on several
program committees, as a journal editor, and as an NSF panelist.  He wrote a
binary-optimizing, multi-grained parallelizing compiler as part of his Ph.D. at
Carnegie Mellon University.  Before grad school, in the 80s, he did stints in a
couple of start-ups, working on a voice recognizer and a VLIW mini-super
computer.  He's glad to be working on volume products that his Mom uses.</p>
