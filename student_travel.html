<p>A limited number of travel grants are available to students and junior faculty attending the conference.</p>

  <li>Co-author of a paper</li>
</ul>
<p>2. Junior faculty who are presenting a paper at the conference and
have extenuating circumstances (e.g., you are a primary caregiver and
must bring your child) or lack sufficient funding (corroborated by your
department head).</p>

<p> Availability and demand will determine the amount of the grant.
    In previous years, grants were no less than $200, with an upper
    limit of $1000.00 The grant is used to help fund travel, hotel
    costs, and registration. Applications will be accepted up
    to <b>April 2, 2010</b>, and will be given on a first come basis
    within the above priorities. Actual payment will occur after the
    close of the conference.</p>
