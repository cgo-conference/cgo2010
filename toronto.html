<h1>Toronto Local Information (*)</h1>

<p>
Toronto is the capital of the Ontario province, and the largest city in Canada. The population of Toronto and its suburbs (aka GTA = Greater Toronto Area) is 5.5 million+. English is the main language in Toronto. Toronto is one of the most diverse cities in the world with about half of its residents born outside of Canada.<a href="http://www.toronto.ca/">Toronto's Official Website</a>.
</p>
<p>
Orientation: The city is located on the north-western shore of Lake Ontario. Most streets are on a grid system (i.e., north-south & east-west). Street numbers on north-south streets increase as you go north (away from the lake). Yonge Street is the central street that runs north-south. Yonge street is said to be the longest street in the world with a length of 1,896km (1,178 miles). Street numbers on east-west streets increase as you go away from Yonge Street.
</p>
<p>
<B>Public Transit:</B> Getting around the city is very easy by public transit (called the TTC). There are subways, buses and streetcars. When entering the TTC you pay a fare and can obtain a slip of paper called a transfer (either from the bus or streetcar driver or from a red machine in subway station entrances). A transfer allows you to transfer from one TTC vehicle to another any number of times and is valid as long as you are making one continuous journey, in one direction, without stopovers. If you pay cash (with exact change), a trip fare is $3. At the entrance to any subway station, you can buy 5 tokens for $12.50 ($2.50 per ride), or a weekly pass (valid for unlimited use from Monday to Sunday) for $36. TTC also offers one day passes for $10. A day pass allows for unlimited one-day travel on all regular TTC services. On Saturdays, Sundays and statutory holidays, one day pass can be used for 2 adults and up to 4 children/youths 19 age or younger. More information can be found at the TTC website <a href="http://www.ttc.ca">here</a>.
</p>
<p>
<B>Toronto Map:</b> You can find a pretty detailed map of GTA and its public transit system at any subway stations. The map is free. Just ask for a TTC (Toronto Transit Commission) map at one of the subway station booths. There is a nice online map <a href="http://crazedmonkey.com/toronto-transit-map">here</a>.

<p>
<b>About Canada:</b> The official languages are English and French. The country is divided into ten provinces and three territories. Quebec City, the oldest permanent European settlement in Canada celebrated is over 400th years old, although the Vikings briefly settled in Newfoundland around A.D. 1000. Canada became an independent Dominion on July 1, 1867, and underwent several territorial expansions between then and July 1, 1949 (when Newfoundland joined Confederation).
