                        ===============

          Seventh Workshop on Explicitly Parallel Instruction
       Computing Architectures and Compiler Technology (EPIC-8)
                         April 24, 2010
                         Toronto, Canada

      In conjunction with the IEEE/ACM International Symposium
             on Code Generation and Optimization (CGO)

Researchers from both academia and industry are invited to share their
latest research findings in the area of EPIC architectures and compiler
technology. The EPIC style of architecture was developed to enable new
levels of instruction-level parallelism not achieved with traditional
architectures. By allowing the compiler to express program parallelism
and other relevant information directly to the processor, EPIC
architectures can overcome hardware complexity issues that limit
performance in traditional microprocessors.

The major challenge in realizing the full potential of EPIC architectures
is developing compiler and runtime optimization technologies that
effectively deploy explicitly defined hardware mechanisms, and deliver
performance for both commercial and scientific applications. This
workshop will focus on promising research concepts that enable the EPIC
architecture model.
