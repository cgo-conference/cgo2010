<h1>Call For Papers</h1>
<p>The International Symposium on Code Generation and 
      Optimization (CGO) provides a premier venue to bring together researchers 
      and practitioners working at the interface of hardware and software on a wide range
of optimization and code generation techniques and related issues. The
conferences spans the spectrum from purely static to fully dynamic approaches,
including techniques ranging from pure software-based methods to architectural
features and support. Original contributions are solicited in areas including
but not limited to the following:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Compilers, back-end code generators, translators, binary optimization tools and runtime environments; static, dynamic, adaptive, or continuous techniques
	<li>New or improved optimization algorithms, including profile-guided and feedback-directed optimization
	<li>Thread extraction and threadlevel speculation, especially for multicore and manycore systems
	<li>Analyses, and optimizations targeting heterogeneous processors and/or GPUs
	<li>Virtualization support for multicore and/or heterogeneous computing
	<li>Phase detection and analysis techniques
	<li>Language features and runtime support for parallelism (including support for transactional semantics, efficient message passing, and dynamic thread creation)
	<li>Program characterization methods targeted at program optimization
	<li>Code transformations to address security, reliability, virtualization, temperature, or energy efficiency
	<li>Architectural support for improved profiling, optimization and code generation
	<li>Experiences with real dynamic optimization and compilation systems on general purpose, embedded system and HPC platforms
	<li>Library and system call support for optimization and code generation
	<li>Solutions that involve crosslayer (HW/OS/VM/SW) design integration
	<li>Efficient profiling and instrumentation techniques
	<li>Memory management, including data distribution, synchronization and garbage collection
	<li>Intermediate representations that enable more powerful or efficient optimization
	<li>Traditional compiler optimizations
