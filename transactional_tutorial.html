<h3>Abstract</h3>
<p>
The advent of multi-core processors in the mainstream computing market is forcing programmers to shift from writing sequential code to building concurrent applications. Today, concurrent programs are typically synchronized using locks. However, it is hard to write correct and scalable programs using locks. Fine-grained locks may not compose and are prone to deadlocks. Coarse-grained locks may not deliver the performance promised by multi-core processors. Recently, Transactional Memory (TM) has been proposed as an alternative to locks for multi-core programming. TM has attracted a lot of attention as a safer, more modular, and more scalable concurrency control mechanism.

<p>
This tutorial will provide a comprehensive overview of transactional memory: description of transactional language extensions and their semantics as well as discussion of important aspects of a software transactional memory (STM) system implementation. We will show how to extend C/C++ with transactional constructs and how these constructs alleviate some of the problems related to programming with locks. We will also present the fundamentals of implementing STM algorithms for C/C++ in the TM runtime, describe how TM support can be elegantly expressed in a form of an application interface and discuss generation of the code by the TM compiler that makes appropriate use of such interface.
